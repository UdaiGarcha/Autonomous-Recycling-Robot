# Autonomous-Recycling-Robot

As we look at a big issue, climate change. There is a large push towards reducing waste by implementing more recycling practices. However recycling is often overlooked because it is a tedious time-consuming project. With recent advances in technological automating recycling has become more common.

In project 3, we had two individual sub-teams, the Modelling sub-team and the Computing sub-team. Each team is given the task of automatizing the recycling process with the use of a Q-Arm and a Q-Bot, paired with a custom designed hopper mechanism and a computer program to repeatedly command the robots in a continuous recycling process.
